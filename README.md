# Graphic Design

Playing in bands growing up, we were always forced to do much of our design work ourselves. This practice grew into more of a hobby over the years and led to opportunities to design and produce some cool pieces of art. Some of this work resides in this repository.

## Whatever Brains

* **WB #2**
	
	The minimalist design of this record's artwork was built around a famous photograph of [Manute Bol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manute_Bol). The banner in the image was doctored in Photoshop to display the band's name, while the other artwork was designed in Fireworks.

* **Saddle Up 7"**

	This design incorporates an image of [Cliff Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Burton). The image clearly was given a newsprint effect, and all other artowkr on this record are hand-drawn.

## Shards
